# SrvStart

This directory contains the following files for SrvStart:

1. Run-time artefacts (programs and executables): **`srvstart_run.v110.zip`**
1. Documentation: **`srvstart_doc.v110.zip`**

I am indebted to Sridhar Boovaraghavan (<sridhar_ml@yahoo.com>) for producing a version of SrvStart
which is compatible with Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition.
It is functionally equivalent to the original version.
