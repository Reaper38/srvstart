# Logger

This directory contains the following files for Logger:

1. Run-time artefacts (programs and executables): **`logger_run.v210.zip`**
1. Documentation: **`logger_doc.v210.zip`**
1. Complete source code: **`logger_src.v210.zip`**
1. Build artefacts: **`logger_bld.v210.zip`**
1. VS 2017 Files: **`logger.v220.zip`**.

I am indebted to Sridhar Boovaraghavan (<sridhar_ml@yahoo.com>) for producing a version of Logger
which is compatible with Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition.
It  is functionally equivalent to the original version.
